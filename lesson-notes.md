Day 122 - reading the PHP documentation and function exploration.

————

echo:  confirmed that echo can only output STRINGS.  This excludes ARRAYS.

strlen():  get the length of a specified string (a variable can also be input here)

array_push;  use to push many elements to an array; if only one element needs to be pushed the following code can be used:

	$array1[] = “string”;

var_dump; gives more specific information about an array; data type, string length if it’s a string,

trim - Removes whitespace or other specified characters from a string

array_slice - Returns elements of an array based on offset and length parameters.  This will make more sense after practicing it.  Watching a side YouTube video of someone using this function helped to clarify what “offset” and “length” meant.

function.mail - going to try to use this function for my business site (and personal dev site) buildout — for clients to get in touch with us!

User feedback can be up- and down-voted;  I saw a record 55 downvotes for one user-contributed note….but it makes sense….the person gave an obscure function without explaining what it actually did or how it was related to the article (the explode function).
