What my wife and I liked most about your team was the professional and classy touch [the musicians] added to the ceremony. All the guests favorably commented on the sound and the elegance those two violinists provided to the wedding. It really propelled the event beyond what we could have previously imagined. Thank you so much.

Ned and Ninja Strings were absolutely wonderful at our wedding this past October! My husband and I couldn't believe how accommodating Ned was to our song requests. He and his trio learned many new songs for us, and they were performed to perfection. Their sound added such a unique and beautiful element to our wedding. I can't recommend them enough!

The Ninja Strings Quartet was amazing! They provided the music I requested and even arranged songs and they sounded beautiful! I would highly recommend them for any event!

​We had  Ninja Strings perform for our son's wedding and we give them 5 stars. They were very nice, on time, well-dressed, and played beautifully. The entire wedding was elevated by the superb playing ability of these fine musicians.  They surpassed our high expectations and made the day special.

Ned, 
Thank you so much!  We really enjoyed working with you.  You made the process completely stress free, were very accommodating with song preferences, and sounded amazing!  We appreciate your flexibility with weather temperature changes and finding solutions for our outdoor ceremony. 
Thank you!

Dear Ninja Strings -- thank you so much for our beautiful music at our ceremony and cocktail hour!  Your unique sound added such a special touch to our wedding.  Also, thank you for taking the time to learn some new songs for us!  It was very much appreciated.  Will and I are sorry we didn't get a chance to thank you in person -- we didn't want to interrupt your beautiful music and had so many people to say hello to!  Thanks so much!



-- sincerely, Emma and Will



We highly recommend Ninja Strings for any event—they are true experts in their craft. We worked closely with Ned, who was extremely professional, gracious, and we knew we were in very capable hands the whole way through. 

Not only were they a huge value add to our wedding ceremony and cocktail hour, but were also so collaborative and open to our music selections. They completely blew us and our guests away with their sound and talent. We continue to hear from our friends and family about how beautiful each song was from start to finish. They were able to arrange every single song we requested, including Israel Kamakawiwoʻole's version of "Somewhere Over the Rainbow", which I walked down the aisle to and the music had people in tears, bride and groom included! 


It was so moving and meaningful to have them play such a large part on our wedding day.


With sincere gratitude,
Emily & Andrew
