<p>You are on the stage of the game show "What's Your Prize?"  Applause and cheering come from the crowd.  You're behind a podium between two other contestants; a reasonably professional-looking young man on your right; a dignified, middle-aged Asian woman is on your left.  It's your turn to answer a question.  The host wears a yellow pinstriped suit, a blue shirt, and magenta tie; his glasses have rose-colored lenses and his hair is spiked blonde.  He grins at you.</p>

<p>"Are you ready for the next question?" he asks, smiling, revealing a set of dazzling white teeth.</p>

<p>"Ready as I'll ever be, Jake," you say. The audience laughs and applauds.</p>

<p>The lights dim. "Here's your question," says the host. Some suspenseful music begins to come from the speakers around the stage.</p>

<p>"In Quentin Tarantino's 1994 blockbuster film 'Pulp Fiction', how does the character The Wolf take his coffee?"</p>

<p>You think for a moment. I know this one, you think to yourself.  What do you say?</p>
