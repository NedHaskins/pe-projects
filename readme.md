Hello!  Thanks for visiting my site!

This folder contains:

- pages for my personal web development site

- projects, both completed and in progress, from the Design for the Web course I'm currently enrolled in

The **archive** folder contains earlier versions of some pages for the personal site and early projects that no longer represent my current skill level (but still have didactic value).

The **svg**, **images**, and **css** directories contain files connected with my personal site.

The **projects** folder contains completed class projects. The ones I feel represent my current skill set, or the ones I've learned the most from, can be found at the following link:

Please also visit my home base on the web!

Thanks for visiting!  Enjoy exploring!
