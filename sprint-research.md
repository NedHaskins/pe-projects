Break down page layout elements.
Headers, modules, sections, etc.

Break down typography elements:  fonts, colors, shapes, angles.

Spent some time looking up beach-themed fonts.

————

I spent the first hour taking screenshots of elements on several different summer rental property sites.

Commonalities:  the biggest one was the universal presence of blue in the color palette, often tinged with green.  The background color was white across the board.  A few sites had scrolling photos of the beach landscape as the first visible background.  I can see the influence of Airbnb on a lot of these sites (or is it that Airbnb has just refined the “go-to” template for real estate rentals to a really high degree and other sites just haven’t committed as far?). Three of the sites featured an immediate option to narrow down check-in and check-out dates.
The option to look for “commonly searched items” is a module that popped up a lot also (searching for “Oceanfront Properties” or “Pet-Friendly Properties”).

What is working? (for each of the categories above)

All of the websites I visited have gotten wise to responsive layout.

All of them had a pretty good idea of how to convey the “beach mood” through color.

What isn’t?

Some of the more “independent” or “smaller” sites didn’t look too great on the small screen.

The creative use of fonts didn’t come up on these sites.  The fonts used were generic and often didn’t pair well together.

What keywords or phrases keep coming up?

“experience,”  “getaway,” phrases that encourage immediate action - “Don’t miss out!”, “Act now!”, etc.

What is hitting you on the head?  (how to interpret this?)

I’m guessing this question is asking what things are the most memorable — for better or worse.  All of the material I’ve looked at definitely ATTEMPTS to convey the “vacation” or “getaway” mindset.  In general, the layout of all of the websites is hampering this process.  It’s just a feeling, but it just doesn’t feel that the designers thought about how all of these rectangles and sharp edges take away from what should be.  Granted, they are sales websites — but more time could be spent on building up the mood and the desire to “get away” before offering an immediate call-to-action (such as “Check availability” - not really the best thing to show first)…

It could be possible that I’m underestimating the urgency that the user may feel, as many vacation properties are in high demand — so they may indeed be rushing to purchase a property.
