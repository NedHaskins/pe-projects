Review of forms:


 # Burooj

_How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do?_

Yes

_Are the inputs and buttons legible? Do they have labels?_

Yes; each element is clearly labeled.

_Does the form work? Can you break it?_

The forms work.  I didn't see anything broken.


_Do things jump around when you interact with them?_

There's some hover tricks and "ghostly" text effects.

_Is the outcome clear?_

Yes

_Do the form styles match across all forms?_

Yes

_Is it a pleasure to use?_

-Very cool personal touch to the names page -- the response changes depending whose name's in there!  Alpha-4 names get special treatment.  Nice job.

_What could be improved?_

Honestly not anything I can see -- I dig the approach, the style is gritty and a little chaotic but it could definitely be an interesting base for a lot of artsy projects.


 # Andy

_How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do?_

It all looks logical.  Headings below each exercise explain what the form does.  Clear.

_Does the form work? Can you break it?_

No, checks are in place to require inputs to proceed.

_Do things jump around when you interact with them?_

No, the forms are pretty static -- not a bad thing

_Is the outcome clear?_

Yes

_Do the form styles match across all forms?_

Yes

_Is it a pleasure to use?_

Yes, very simple and clear interface.  The array display at the top gives the curious user a look under the hood.  Nice addition.

_What could be improved?_

The margin-top on the array object at the top of the page looks a little narrow in relation to the sides.
Maybe experiment with other typefaces?  The layout looks great but the text seems a little plain.

_How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do?_

_Does the form work? Can you break it?_

The form works.  The array contents are spelled out at the bottom of the forms.

_Do things jump around when you interact with them?_

They don't really jump, but the buttons have a nice "pressed" effect.

_Is the outcome clear?_

Yes

_Do the form styles match across all forms?_

Yes

_Is it a pleasure to use?_

Yes - the forms are really attractive -- the design choices are very strong; the background gradient is nice and works well with the gold tinge on the buttons and some layout elements.  The font choice fits well.

_What could be improved?_

The spacing isn't consistent between some of the page elements (i.e. in the Room Area form, the button is way above the heading text -- that could be evened out with bigger margins on the top and left of the button).

# John

_How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do?_

The concept is cool. 

_Does the form work? Can you break it?_

One of the forms doesn't have a space for input right now.

_Do things jump around when you interact with them?_

No

_Is the outcome clear?_

Sort of.  It's not clear what will happen once the info is entered in the name entry form.

_Do the form styles match across all forms?_

Yes, the fonts and background colors match.

_Is it a pleasure to use?_

It honestly doesn't make too much of an impact in either a good or bad way right now.

_What could be improved?_

Just finish them out, they just need to be fleshed out and added to.

# Tara

_How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do?_

Yes, each form has a clear explanation at the top.

_Does the form work? Can you break it?_

I tried to break them and couldn't.

_Do things jump around when you interact with them?_

No

_Is the outcome clear?_

Yes

_Do the form styles match across all forms?_

Yes

_Is it a pleasure to use?_

I liked navigating them and like the font used for the heading a lot.
The links open up in new tabs, which makes it tough to navigate back a page.

_What could be improved?_

Layout-wise, everything is bunched up at the top of the page right now -- more vertical spacing between elements would help!

_How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do?_

The form landing page doesn't give an idea of the content of the links - there's no heading or explanation.

_Does the form work? Can you break it?_

The forms work.

_Do things jump around when you interact with them?_

No

_Is the outcome clear?_

I can gather what the outcome should be from the title and inputs needed.

_Do the form styles match across all forms?_

Fonts and background color match but only some of the forms have headings and explanations.

_Is it a pleasure to use?_

At the moment they just feel incomplete -- there's not really anything to make them stand out and the group of pages as a whole doesn't feel totally unified yet.

_What could be improved?_

# Steve

_How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do?_

Yes, from a heading explanation that the forms have.

_Does the form work? Can you break it?_

The forms work -- entries are required to proceed.

_Do things jump around when you interact with them?_

No

_Is the outcome clear?_

Only for the login form is the output not shown -- you could put "Succesfully logged in" here or "Bad credentials" or something similar if it didn't work.

_Do the form styles match across all forms?_

Yes

_Is it a pleasure to use?_

I like the gradient and box outline a lot -- they work together well.

_What could be improved?_

It's not totally clear what will happen on the multiple text input form -- the output was hard to predict.

Ad for the layout, Try some new fonts and experiement with spacing the text boxes out more with margins / padding!
