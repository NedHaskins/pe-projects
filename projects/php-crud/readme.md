This project is a series of webpages making use of the CRUD framework -- the user can dynamically manipulate the data on the page and ultimately will be able to create new data, read the current data (by loading a page or pages), and update or delete the data.

The webpages are written in HTML, CSS and PHP.

I chose to build out a page detailing highway routes in the state of Virginia.  The home page details the purpose of the site and how to navigate it. The user can choose to learn more about one of three types of highways - interstate routes, US routes, and state routes.

The navigation bar has four route lists -- a general list that includes all routes and 3 filtered lists that return routes of a particular type.

The "Create a Route" page allows the user to enter new information about a route and to upload it to the page.
