**Day 165 video notes**

- Using parent elements on text and photos to allow for flex-column on the small screen and flex-row on the larger screen.

- Using object.fit to work with photos (extra challenge)

- Taking a screenshot of the mockup and keeping it in front of you as you work out the code

- Using a dynamic loop to call and script out the individual modules…

- File naming conventions — make a decision on which convention works best for you—

- A list of articles — would be included in a list element!  (ordered or unordered).

- Interesting that you can simply put elements in an array and the loop will return the specified items based on the number of items in the array (they can be anything—)

- Basing site typography on a “living style guide”

- The idea of putting in elements for screen-readers only is coming up again.  Hide the heading so it doesn’t take up its own grid cell.

- Using grid {gap}  to create the space between the text and photos without haveing to set and then undo margin-top (in a flex setup)

Lots of considerations to make about a layout before the code makes an appearance.  Will text boxes align with images?  What “guides” will be followed?

When you’re about to commit the code — are there any last / small opportunities to improve it before pushing?

Custom properties can be used for element spacing features that show up often—

Short speedrun:  Place selectors in the CSS as “outlines” before you define any properties, i.e. specific contexts, breakpoints.

Grid - “defining the template” versus “putting an element INSIDE the defined template”
