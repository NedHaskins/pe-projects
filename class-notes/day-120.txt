“User agent styles” - appearance depends on browser

 <input> types:  ‘text’, ‘number’, ‘email’, ‘password’, ‘submit’, ‘range’

	•	Use <button> for the submit type to differentiate it from the inputs on the form 



“Componentize” elements by putting them in a div….<div class=‘field’>

	•	Input fonts (in the field) don’t inherit from the rest of the page so that needs to be specified when writing out CSS

SUPER GLOBALS!!

POST and GET.

Inside some PHP brackets, create a variable and equate it with $_POST.

echo $_POST[“message”];

CSS styling can be customized for specific output  values.
(by using the inline style element!!  =D)

Not really sure what the point of assigning type to “number” is if the output is just going to be a string anyway.  Does it make sense to try and do something with the type?
